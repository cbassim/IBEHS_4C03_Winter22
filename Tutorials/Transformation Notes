Transforming Data for Linear Regression

 try p rasied to the (-1,-0.5, ln=0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2)

 Look at the histogram of the residuals 

Right (positive skew):
square root transformation
log transformation
reciprocal transformation  

Left (negative) skew:
square transformation
exponential transformation

 If linearity is the problem: transform the predictor
 If linearity and or equality of variance are the problem: transform the response or both

 Careful about negative numbers in your data with transformations

 Remember that your model is now in transformed values.
